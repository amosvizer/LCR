## 5.1 HOMEPAGE

The homepage must accomplish three things in under 5 seconds: establish authority, communicate the AI differentiator, and create a clear path to action. It is structured in distinct scrolling sections.

### Section 1: Hero

**Background:** Deep Space Blue (#0B1C2E) with subtle animated particle grid or abstract circuit-board pattern suggesting AI/data processing.

### Section 3: The LCR Advantage (Why Us)

**Section Headline:** Why Aviation Leaders Choose LCR

**Section Subtext:** In an industry where the cost of error is existential, you need a partner who has sat in the FAA’s seat and understands exactly what it takes to earn approval.

Display as an alternating content layout (image/text on alternating sides) with 4 blocks:

- **Block 1 — Former FAA Inspectors, Not Just Consultants:** “Our team members served as FAA Principal Operations Inspectors, Airworthiness Inspectors, and Aviation Safety Inspectors. When your documentation reaches the FAA, we’ve already reviewed it through the lens of the people who will evaluate it. This insider perspective is why we maintain a 95%+ first-time DCT acceptance rate.”
- **Block 2 — AI-Enhanced Precision (“ROI with AI”):** “We are the only boutique certification consultancy using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Machine Learning to verify every regulatory citation against the latest 14 CFR, 49 CFR, FAA Advisory Circulars, and Orders. Every paragraph in your manual is cross-referenced and auditable. This means fewer revision cycles, faster FAA acceptance, and lower total project cost.”
- **Block 3 — Speed Without Shortcuts:** “Certification timelines directly impact your revenue. Every day grounded is money lost. By combining AI-accelerated documentation with expert human review, we consistently help clients achieve their objectives faster — reducing rework, shortening approval cycles, and keeping overall project costs historically low.”
- **Block 4 — Full-Spectrum Discipline Coverage:** “Unlike firms that specialize in a single area, we support the complete operational ecosystem: Flight Operations, Dispatch/Flight Following, Maintenance, HAZMAT, Inflight, Ground Operations, Cabin Safety, Passenger and Cargo Handling, SMS, and Company Procedures. One coordinated team. One consistent methodology.”
