## 5.5 SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (/solutions/safety-sms)

**Page H1:** Safety Management Systems & Compliance Programs

**Page Intro:** An effective Safety Management System is not a binder on a shelf. It is a living operational framework that identifies hazards, manages risks, and drives continuous improvement. Under 14 CFR Part 5, SMS is a regulatory requirement for Part 121 operators, and it is rapidly becoming the expected standard for Part 135 and 145 certificate holders. LCR Aero Group designs SMS programs that are practical to operate, efficient to maintain, and demonstrably effective in reducing operational risk.

### Our SMS Approach

We structure every SMS program around the four ICAO pillars, tailored to the size and complexity of your operation:

- **Safety Policy:** Organizational commitment, safety objectives, accountability structures, and management responsibility documentation.
- **Safety Risk Management (SRM):** Systematic hazard identification, risk assessment, and mitigation strategy development. We use data-driven methodologies to prioritize risks by severity and likelihood.
- **Safety Assurance (SA):** Continuous monitoring, internal evaluation, and management-of-change processes. We design SAS-compatible data collection tools and performance metrics.
- **Safety Promotion:** Training programs, communication strategies, and safety culture development that embed safety awareness across your organization.
