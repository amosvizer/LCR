# 6. INTERACTIVE TOOLS & LEAD GENERATION

Interactive tools provide immediate value to visitors and capture high-quality leads. They lower the friction of the first interaction by offering something useful before asking for a meeting.

## 6.1 Certification Readiness Assessment

A 10–15 question diagnostic quiz that scores the user’s preparedness for certification across key dimensions. The user selects their target certification (Part 121, 135, 145), answers questions about their current state (Do you have a designated Director of Operations? Do you have a completed GOM? etc.), and receives a scored “Readiness Report” with recommendations. The report is gated — the user provides their email to receive the full PDF.

## 6.2 Interactive Compliance Timeline

A tool where users select their aircraft type and intended operation, and the site generates a visual timeline of required regulatory milestones and estimated durations. This provides the user with a realistic expectation of the certification timeline and positions LCR as the expert guide.

## 6.3 Newsletter (“Regulatory Watch”)

Positioned not as a marketing newsletter but as a “Regulatory Watch” subscription. Monthly email with FAA regulatory updates, industry analysis, and certification tips. Sign-up form should be present in the Knowledge Hub, the site footer, and as a slide-in prompt after 60 seconds on any Knowledge Hub article.
