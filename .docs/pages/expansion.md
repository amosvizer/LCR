## 5.4 OPERATIONAL EXPANSION & MAJOR CHANGES (/solutions/expansion)

**Page H1:** Operational Expansion & Major Change Projects

**Page Intro:** Growing your operation — whether adding a new fleet type, expanding to international routes, or implementing advanced technologies — requires FAA approval through a structured change management process. LCR Aero Group manages these complex projects with the same rigor and precision we bring to initial certifications, using the FAA’s Master Change Process Document (MCPD) framework.

**Addition of New Aircraft Types:** “Adding a new make and model to your Operations Specifications (OpSpecs) involves a comprehensive design and performance assessment. LCR manages the entire MCPD 5-Phase process: Initial Inquiry, Application, Element Design Assessment (EDA), Element Performance Assessment (EPA), and FAA Administrative Functions. We update all affected manuals, training programs, and MEL/MMEL documentation, and coordinate with your FSDO and assigned principal inspectors.”

**ETOPS Implementation:** “Extended Operations (ETOPS) authorization allows twin-engine aircraft to fly routes that take them more than 60 minutes from an adequate airport. LCR prepares the complete ETOPS program including maintenance requirements, dispatch procedures, crew training, and the Configuration, Maintenance, and Procedures (CMP) document. We ensure your program meets the requirements of 14 CFR §121.374.”

**Extended Overwater Operations (EWO):** “Operations conducted beyond 50 nautical miles from the nearest shoreline require specific equipment, training, and procedural authorizations. LCR develops the required supplemental documentation, emergency equipment requirements, and crew training modules.”

**Transition Between Operations Types:** “Transitioning between Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental operations involves significant manual revisions, crew training updates, and FAA coordination. LCR manages these transitions to minimize operational disruption while ensuring complete regulatory compliance.”

**Controller-Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC):** “CPDLC authorization enables digital text-based communication between pilots and air traffic controllers. LCR prepares the required training programs, operational procedures, and performance monitoring documentation.”

**Additional Repair Station Ratings:** “Expanding your Part 145 capability list to include new ratings requires updated documentation, quality control procedures, and FAA evaluation. LCR prepares all required materials and coordinates with your certificate management team.”

**SMS Implementation (Parts 121, 135, and 145):** “Safety Management System implementation is now required for Part 121 operators and increasingly expected for Part 135 and 145 certificate holders. LCR develops and implements SMS programs that are practical, measurable, and aligned with both 14 CFR Part 5 requirements and ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).”

**IATA Compliance:** “For operators seeking or maintaining IATA membership, we ensure your operational programs meet IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) requirements and prepare your team for successful audit outcomes.”

**DoD Compliance:** “Operators seeking Department of Defense contract eligibility must meet additional safety and operational requirements. LCR prepares your programs and documentation to satisfy DoD evaluation criteria.”
