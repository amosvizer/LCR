## 5.3 CERTIFICATION SERVICES (/solutions/certification)

**Page H1:** FAA Air Carrier & Air Agency Certification

**Page Intro:** Obtaining an Air Carrier or Operating Certificate is one of the most complex regulatory undertakings in aviation. It requires subject matter expertise across operations, maintenance, training, safety, and security — all coordinated through a rigorous 5-Phase FAA process. LCR Aero Group has successfully guided dozens of operators through initial certification, managing every phase from pre-application through certificate issuance. Our team of former FAA Aviation Safety Inspectors understands exactly what the FAA looks for, because we used to be the ones looking.

### The FAA 5-Phase Certification Process

**Phase 1: Pre-Application — **“This phase begins when you first contact the FAA about certification. LCR conducts a comprehensive readiness assessment of your organization, identifies gaps in personnel, manuals, training programs, and operational infrastructure, and develops a detailed Schedule of Events. We prepare you to make a strong first impression at the pre-application meeting with your assigned Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).”

**Phase 2: Formal Application — **“We compile and review your formal application package, ensuring all required documents are present, properly formatted, and compliant. This includes management resumes, organizational charts, compliance statements, and preliminary manual drafts. We coordinate with the Certification Project Manager (CPM) and Certification Project Team (CPT) to ensure your package is accepted without revision.”

**Phase 3: Design Assessment (DA) — **“This is the most labor-intensive phase. The FAA evaluates the design of your operating systems to ensure regulatory compliance. LCR develops and prepares all required manuals, training curricula, and safety programs. Our AI-powered compliance tools verify every regulatory citation against the current 14 CFR and FAA guidance. We prepare all Data Collection Tool (DCT) submissions — and our 95%+ first-time acceptance rate means you move to Phase 4 faster than the industry average.”

**Phase 4: Performance Assessment (PA) — **“The FAA observes your operations in action to confirm your systems perform as designed. LCR supports you through proving tests, demonstration flights, emergency evacuation demonstrations, and operational evaluations. We ensure your team is prepared, your processes are executed correctly, and the FAA’s Element Performance Assessment (EPA) observations reflect a well-run operation.”

**Phase 5: Administrative Functions — **“The final phase: the FAA issues your Air Carrier or Operating Certificate and Operations Specifications (OpSpecs). LCR ensures all administrative requirements are met, all documentation is finalized, and your transition to ongoing operations is seamless.”

### Certification Types We Support

**14 CFR Part 121 — Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations:** Part 121 certification is required for scheduled airlines, flag carriers, and supplemental operators. The process involves extensive manual development, DCT submission, proving runs, and FAA evaluation across all operational disciplines. LCR has managed Part 121 certifications for startup airlines, cargo carriers, and operators transitioning between certificate types. We provide complete manual system development including the General Operations Manual (GOM), Flight Operations Manual (FOM), General Maintenance Manual (GMM), cabin safety programs, HAZMAT programs, dispatch/flight following procedures, and all required training curricula.

**14 CFR Part 135 — Commuter and On-Demand Operations:** Part 135 certification covers charter, air taxi, commuter, and on-demand operations. We support the full range of Part 135 certificates: Single-Pilot, Basic, 9 or Fewer Passengers, 10 or More Passengers, and Commuter operations. Whether you are a startup seeking your first certificate or an existing operator upgrading your authority, LCR manages the entire process including manual preparation, SAS portal submissions, and FAA coordination.

**14 CFR Part 145 — Repair Station Certification:** Part 145 certification is required for organizations performing maintenance, preventive maintenance, or alterations of aircraft, airframes, aircraft engines, propellers, appliances, or component parts. LCR develops your Repair Station Manual (RSM) and Quality Control Manual (QCM), prepares your capability list, and guides you through the FAA’s evaluation process. We also support dual-certification needs for organizations requiring both FAA and EASA approval.

**14 CFR Part 137 — Agricultural Aircraft Operations:** Part 137 certification covers aerial application of pesticides, fertilizers, seeds, and other materials. LCR provides manual development, operational procedures, and FAA coordination for agricultural aircraft operators, including congested area waivers and specialized equipment requirements.
